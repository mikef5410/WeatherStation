The Syntax.

This is going to short and sweet. If you need more info, buy me
some time.

The input file is divided into Sections. Each section is optionally
subdivided into Classes. Here's a sketch:

optk: asdflj
optj: asdf
Section Foo
   opt1: df
 Class a
   opt1: sadf
   opt2: asdf
 Class b
   opt3: 354

Section Bar
 Class merde
    ....


The section preceeding the first section definition is the global defaults
section. Values here are overriden by further section or defaults sections.
The section between a section definition line and the first class line
is called the defaults subsection for that section.

The general rule is that more precise definitions override less precise
ones.
