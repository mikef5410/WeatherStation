* Ignore white spaces between optname and separator.
  - Fixed. There can now be any number (including zero) of spaces before and
    after the option name, the field spearator, and the value.

* Add a float type.
  - Done.

* Case insensitive booleans with stricter value checking.
  - Done. 1, t, T, 0, f, F are all valid.

* Rename Section to Module and rename Class to Configuration.
  -Done.

* Use quotes to define characters and strings.
  -Done. Either single or double quotes may be used for both chars and
   strings. The first character of the passed string is used as the value
   for chars.

* Remove case insensitivity for option names.
  - Done. Actually, this was just a documentation fix. The package
    never did this in the first place.
